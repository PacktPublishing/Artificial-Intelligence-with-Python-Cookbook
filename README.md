This is the code repository for [Artificial Intelligence with Python Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/product/artificial-intelligence-with-python-cookbook/9781789133967), published by Packt.

**Practical recipes for next-generation deep learning and neural networks using TensorFlow and PyTorch**

## What is this book about?
With artificial intelligence (AI) systems, we can develop goal-driven agents to automate problem-solving. This involves predicting and classifying the available data and training agents to execute tasks successfully. This book will help you to solve complex AI problems using practical recipes.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Implement data preprocessing steps and optimize model hyperparameters
* Work with large amounts of data using distributed and parallel computing techniques
* Get to grips with representational learning from images using InfoGAN
* Delve into deep probabilistic modeling with a Bayesian network
* Create your own artwork using adversarial neural networks

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
data = fetch_openml(data_id=42165, as_frame=True)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This AI book is for Python developers, data scientists, machine learning developers, and deep learning practitioners who want to learn how to build artificial intelligence solutions with easy-to-follow recipes. If you are looking for state-of-the-art solutions to perform different machine learning tasks in various use cases, this book is for you. Basic working knowledge of Python programming language and machine learning concepts will help you to work with the code.
